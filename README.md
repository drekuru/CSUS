Anyway getting a BS in Comp Sci doesn't mean you know how to program. Not everyone is good at problem solving...
which is essentially what programming is?

But yeah school is a meme. Good waste of time to get a paper that you can wave around in front of your employers face and tell them, hey! i deserve a job. (you really don't though - school doesn't teach you anything related to the programming that happens in the real world)
